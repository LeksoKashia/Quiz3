Hi, my project is dedicated to people who love mars.
In my project you are able to input a date and a camera model, then program will automatically output a photo information taken on that date by your desired camera,
after that program asks you if you'd like to save the photo, yes means consent and if you input it  photo will be saved.
In addition, the program is connected to database and outputed information is saved in a relation called 'mars_photos'.
